# Digital Edition of Old Komi

This is a digital edition of Old Komi text corpus. It is based into:

> Lytkin, Vasilij I. 1952. *Drevnepermskij jazyk: čtenie tekstov, grammatika, slovar'*. Moskva: Izdat. Akad. Nauk SSSR.

This repository can be considered a derivative work, since the goal is to provide:

- a version where the text is represented in Old Permic character range in Unicode
- new interpretation of the texts
- POS-tagging
- syntactic analysis
- etymological analysis

Currently the resource consists of plain texts and morphologically analysed third person verb forms. In the future the work will be extended to full lemmatization and dependency analysis. 

Niko Partanen has initiated the work, but everybody is invited to collaborate. Everyone who contributes meaningfully is welcome to be added among the authors.
